# Chip-8 Emulator

This repository contains a simple Chip-8 emulator written in C++. Chip-8 is an interpreted programming language developed in the mid-1970s, 
designed to allow video games to be more easily programmed for early microcomputers. This emulator aims to replicate the behavior of the Chip-8 
system to allow these classic games to be played on modern hardware.

## Features
- Emulates Chip-8 opcodes
